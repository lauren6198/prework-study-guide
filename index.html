        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>!Doctype declaration tells the browser what document type it should
            expect when it is opened.</li>
            <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a webpage.</li>
            <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
            <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description,
              keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
            <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
            <li>The html opening tag, which represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.</li>
            <li>Inside the html tag is an attribute of "lang=en", which tells the browser the 
              language for the webpage.</li>
            <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
            <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
            <li>The charset element sets our character encoding.</li>
            <li>The http-equiv element sets an http header for content.</li>
            <li>The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
            <li>Child elements are elements nested within other elements.</li>
            <li>The parent element is the element that holds all the child elements, or 'children.'</li>
            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opeining tag 
              and a closing tag.</li>
            <li>These tags are most often represented by angle brackets with associated names inside the brackets.</li>
            <li>Closing tags will begin with a forward slash.</li>
            <li>We can insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands
              how to treat the content.</li>
            <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
            <li>Tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>Headings are numbered in order and heading 1 should only be on the page once.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items, respectively.</li>
            <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
            <li>The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
            <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
            <li>The a element, or anchor, creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
            <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
            <li>For img elements; the src attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.</li>
            <li>The alt attribute for img elements contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
            <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
            <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage: inline CSS, internal style sheets, and external style sheets.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: Styles an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Inline styles only apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheets: Contains CSS rules that only apply to that page.</li>
          <li>With Internal Style Sheets, you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style 
            multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an External Style Sheet.</li>
          <li>Developers use External Style Sheets to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes
            design changes easier. When using an External Style Sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
           <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on a page. To do that, we use a special
            wild card symbol, or *.</li>
            <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.
              Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same
              styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
            <li>DRY code can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
            <li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
            <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
            <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path.
              This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
              <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.
                Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
