# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The motivation behind this project is to create a webpage that contains information and notes that are useful and helpful for the bootcamp program, as well as for practice and memorization.
- The reasoning for building this project was to provide a resource to myself and other students to refer to throughout the bootcamp program.
- This webpage solves the problem of not having a resource to aid in my learning in this program.
- In creating this project, I have learned HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I have also learned how to create a README.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide contains notes about the topics we will be covering in this program. The topics are HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running correctly after writing the code and debugging issues that arised. The JavaScript in the DevTools console lists the topics we learned from prework and randomly chooses a topic for us to review and study first.
